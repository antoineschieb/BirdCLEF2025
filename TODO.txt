- try BCE, Focal loss? include secondary labels?
- try dropout
- change n_mels, n_fft etc

Eval perf
- check which classes model struggles on
- evaluate extent of domain shift, and try to come up with a solution
    -- cluster data in different locations and measure of performance differs a lot.
- visualize how model performs on soundscapes


rough ideas
- use ratings (data selection)
- data augmentation (spectraugment)


when model is good enough
- train soundscapes pseudo labels
- folds & cross validation
